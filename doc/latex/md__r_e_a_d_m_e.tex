This project is my first large scale C++ project that attempts to incorporate various aspects from a number of my current and previous classes (graphics, algorithms, statistics, etc.). The goal is to write a robust chess application, design an Open\+GL renderer, and create chess engines using various statistical and machine learning models.

\section*{Goals}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Style\+: Ensure that I conform to C++ best practices and make good stylistic decisions when writing the code.
\item Efficiency\+: Utilize efficient algorithms and rendering techniques.
\item Testability\+: Learn C++ testing frameworks and thoroughly test code.
\item Documentation\+: Learn how to properly document C++ code.
\item Design\+: Create a well designed object-\/oriented program.
