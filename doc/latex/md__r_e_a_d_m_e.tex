This project is my first large scale C++ project that attempts to incorporate various aspects from a number of my current and previous classes (graphics, algorithms, statistics, etc.). The goal is to write a robust chess application, design an Open\+GL renderer, and create chess engines using various statistical and machine learning models.

\section*{Goals}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Style\+: Ensure that I conform to C++ best practices and make good stylistic decisions when writing the code.
\item Efficiency\+: Utilize efficient algorithms and rendering techniques.
\item Testability\+: Learn C++ testing frameworks and thoroughly test code.
\item Documentation\+: Learn how to properly document C++ code.
\item Design\+: Create a well designed object-\/oriented program.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{Build (Mac O\+SX)}

Building project requires \href{http://brew.sh/}{\tt Homebrew}.

\#\# Graphics Dependencies 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 brew install glfw3
2 brew install glew
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Testing Dependencies}

\#\#\# Google\+Mock and Google\+Test 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 brew install autoconf
2 git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git
3 cd googletest/googlemock
4 
5 autoreconf -fvi
6 ./configure
7 
8 g++ -I../googletest/include -I../googletest/ -Iinclude -I. -c ../googletest/src/gtest-all.cc 
9 g++ -I../googletest/include -I../googletest/ -Iinclude -I. -c src/gmock-all.cc 
10 ar -rv libgmock.a gtest-all.o gmock-all.o
11 
12 mv libgmock.a lib
13 make
14 make check
\end{DoxyCode}


Next, move the libgmock.\+a file into the lib/ directory of this project. Note that building against googlemock {\itshape also builds against googletest}.
