# 3D Online Chess + Chess Engine
This project is my first large scale C++ project that attempts to incorporate various aspects from a number of my current and previous classes (graphics, algorithms, statistics, etc.). The goal is to write a robust chess application, design an OpenGL renderer, and create chess engines using various statistical and machine learning models.

# Goals
- Style: Ensure that I conform to C++ best practices and make good stylistic decisions when writing the code.
- Efficiency: Utilize efficient algorithms and rendering techniques.
- Testability: Learn C++ testing frameworks and thoroughly test code.
- Documentation: Learn how to properly document C++ code.
- Design: Create a well designed object-oriented program.
