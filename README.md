# Chess
This project is my first large scale C++ project that attempts to incorporate various aspects from a number of my current and previous classes (graphics, algorithms, statistics, etc.). 

## Goals
The goal is to write a robust chess application complete with a playable 3D graphical interface and a variety of chess engines that utilize different statistical and machine learning techniques.
- **Style:** Ensure that I conform to C++/Python best practices and make good stylistic decisions when writing the code. Code should (mostly) conform to the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) and the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).
- **Efficiency:** Utilize efficient algorithms and rendering techniques.
- **Testability:** Learn C++ testing frameworks and thoroughly test code including [Valgrind](http://valgrind.org/) and [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest).
- **Documentation:** Learn how to properly document C++ code using [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/).
- **Design:** Create a well designed object-oriented program.
